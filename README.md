# SenateTrades
SenateTrades is dedicated to holding public officers financially accountable. Our website promotes financial transparency by processing their stock market transactions compiling their portfolios in a accessible and digestible format for the American public. SenateTrades was formed in the wake of the 2020 insider trading scandal, in which a number of senators were accused of using information from private, COVID-19 briefings to inform their stock trades. Many senators believe it is corrupt for public officers to invest in the very companies they regulate, as opposed to having their assets managed in a blind trust. Such a financial arrangement does not allow the owner to see how their portfolios are managed in order to prevent a conflict of interest.
